                        NodeLabels allows the specification of custom roles for your nodes in your managed clusters.
                        These are additional roles that are not used by any OpenShift Container Platform components, only by the user.
                        When you add a custom role, it can be associated with a custom machine config pool that references a specific
                        configuration for that role.
                        Adding custom labels or roles during installation makes the deployment process more effective and prevents the

                              An explicitly set value in spec.oauthMetadata has precedence over this field.
                              This field has no meaning if authentication spec.type is not set to IntegratedOAuth.
                              The key "oauthMetadata" is used to locate the data.
                              If the config map or expected key is not found, no metadata is served.
                              If the specified metadata is not valid, no metadata is served.

                      This field is useful for debugging, auditing, and tracking reinstallation events over time.

                      description: ReinstallHistory represents a record of a reinstallation
                        event for a ClusterInstance.

                        clusterInstanceSpecDiff:
                          description: |-
                            ClusterInstanceSpecDiff provides a JSON representation of the differences between the
                            ClusterInstance spec at the time of reinstallation and the previous spec.
                            This field helps in tracking changes that triggered the reinstallation.

                        generation:
                          description: |-
                            Generation specifies the generation of the ClusterInstance at the time of the reinstallation.
                            This value corresponds to the ReinstallSpec.Generation field associated with the reinstallation request.
